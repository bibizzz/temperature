Start by adding the following line to/boot/config.txt
You can edit that file with nano by runningsudo nano /boot/config.txt and then scrolling to the bottom and
typing it there
dtoverlay=w1-gpio
Then reboot withsudo reboot. When the Pi is back up and you're logged in again, type the commands you see
below into a terminal window. When you are in the 'devices' directory, the directory starting '28-' may have a
different name, so cd to the name of whatever directory is there.
sudo modprobe w1-gpio
sudo modprobe w1-therm
cd /sys/bus/w1/devices
ls
cd 28-xxxx (change this to match what serial number pops up)
